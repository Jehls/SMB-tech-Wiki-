Everything you need to know to run your tech for your small business. 

I am starting to build this now. But right now as I am developing it, if you are stuck, get on your google account. 

Go to Chatgpt.com
- sign in with google (so you get a few more qeuries)
- Ask Chapt GPT the question aka a "prompt" - you can get specfic.
- Ask it how to do it, and list steps and resources.

- Follow the steps.

Welcome to the future.
